      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am an aspiring software engineer. For the past 7 years, I have taught kindergarten and first grade in public schools. I also have a background in linguistics.
        Over the past year, after seeing the challenges of remote learning, I have become more interested in learning what goes on behind the screens of our learning tools.
        I believe that by learning how to program, we can address the issues we face by being physically apart, connected only by our internet.
        <br>I have two sweet young kids, a toddler and an infant, with my husband, James.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>

      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I enjoy music, puzzles, and getting to know new people.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Web developer</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Cary, NC</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I am drawn to the challenge of problem solving and how creative or logistical ideas can be addressed by online or software programs.
        I want to learn to create and improve digital tools that are helpful to users.</p>
